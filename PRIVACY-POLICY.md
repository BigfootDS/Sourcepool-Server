# Sourcepool Privacy Policy

Sourcepool does not send any data back to its developers, not even crash logs or usage analytics.

Sourcepool is meant to be used without a connection to the wider internet - but still using a local area network (LAN).

This means that the Sourcepool Server can be set up to do a bunch of things with user data, such as:

- let you access server data using an authentication session created with your username and password specific to that server
- let you upload images of cool homebrew items, monsters, characters, and so on from your device to be stored within the server

And all of those things will never reach us developers.
